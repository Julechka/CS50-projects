# CS50 Projects

This repository contains my solutions to various assignments and projects from the Harvard University course **CS50: Introduction to Computer Science**. The course covers a wide range of topics including algorithms, data structures, and software engineering.

## Folder Structure

- **Scratch**: Contains projects and assignments completed using Scratch, such as the Space Game.
- **C**: Includes C programming assignments and projects, like Mario and Cash.
- **Python**: Contains Python scripts and solutions to problems from CS50’s problem sets.

## Projects Overview

### Scratch
- Projects for the course **CS50's Introduction to Programming with Scratch**, including 9 projects.
- **Space Game**: A final project — a simple interactive game created using Scratch, where the player controls a spaceship and dodges obstacles.

### C
- Programs: Caesar, Cash, Credit, Filters, Inheritance, Mario, Plurality, Readability, Recover, Runoff, Scrabble, Sort, Speller, Substitution, Tideman, Volume.
- Weeks 2 to 5: A variety of small programs in C.

### Python
- Programs: Cash, Credit, Mario, Readability, DNA.
- Week 6: A series of small programs in Python.

## How to Run the Projects

1. For Scratch projects, open the `.sb3` file in the Scratch online editor or desktop app.
2. For C projects:
   - Compile with `clang` (e.g., `clang mario.c -o mario`).
   - Run the compiled program with `./mario`.
3. For Python projects:
   - Ensure Python is installed.
   - Run with `python filename.py`.
